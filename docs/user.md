# User

## Overview

- The user's `display_name` and `photo_url` are mirrored from Firestore to the Realtime Database.
- The user's `display_name` is also stored in `display_name_lowercase` (in lowercase) for better searchability in both Firestore and the Realtime Database.

## User Authentication

The Super Library supports Firebase user authentication only.

You can continue using FlutterFlow's authentication methods seamlessly with the Super Library.

## UserAvatar

Use the `UserAvatar` widget to display a user's photo.

- **No Photo URL**: If no photo URL is provided, it shows a user icon.
- **Background Color**: The background color is `FlutterFlowTheme.of(context).alternate`.
- **Foreground Color**: The foreground color is `FlutterFlowTheme.of(context).primaryText`.

| No photo url                      | With with photo url                |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ![image.png](/images/image_2.png) | ![image.png](/images/image(2).png) |

## User List View

To list users from the Realtime Database, use the `UserListView` widget.

### Alternative Option

You can also use the built-in FlutterFlow Backend Query to list users from Firestore. This is a fine option if you are not concerned about the cost.

### Customizing the UI

You have several options to customize the UI design:

- **Default UI**: Use the built-in default UI.
- **Default Component**: Use the default component provided.
- **Custom Component**: Design your own component.

### Horizontal Scrolling

You can make the `UserListView` display and scroll horizontally.

### Examples

## How to Customize UI Design in UserListView

### Step 1: Create UserListIcon Component

- **Parameters**:
    - `uid` (String, required)
    - `displayName` (String, required)
    - `photoUrl` (ImagePath, optional)

### Step 2: Design UserListIcon Component

- Customize the design of the `UserListIcon` component as needed.

### Step 3: Create PublicProfileScreen

- **Screen Name**: You can name this screen as you like.

### Step 4: Add onTap Action to UserListIcon

- **Action**: Open the `PublicProfileScreen` when `UserListIcon` is tapped.
- **Customization**: You can add any action and customize the UI/UX as desired.

### Step 5: Design PublicProfileScreen

- Customize the design of the `PublicProfileScreen` as needed.

## Different UI Design on Each Screen

You can design a different UI on each screen by following these steps:

1. **Design the Component**:
    1. Create components to display user in each screen.
2. **Call a Custom Action**:
    1. Use a custom action to set the `userListTile` component.
    2. Example: `Component.userListTile = (user) => ...`



# User Search

The Super Library does not provide UI or code for user search due to FlutterFlow's limitations. Follow these steps to create your own user search:

## Setting Up User Search

1. **Add `display_name_lowercase` Field**:
    1. This field will be automatically saved in the Firestore user document.
    2. Add a field named `display_name_lowercase` in the user schema.
    3. This field will store the lowercase version of the user's `display_name`.
2. **Search Implementation**:
    1. Compare user input in lowercase to the value of `display_name_lowercase`.
    2. Use the `.toLowerCase()` method for comparison.

## Search Options

You can filter/search the user's `display_name_lowercase`:

- **Equality Match**: Exact match.
- **Partial Match**: Match the beginning part of the name.

## Note

This is the nature of how FlutterFlow works, so the Super Library does not provide any UI for this feature. For an example, please see the [Super Library sample project](https://app.flutterflow.io/project/test-super-library-ldkmay).

You can also write custom code to search for users in the Realtime Database.

## Search Users by `display_name` (Case-Insensitive)

### Example Users

Letâ€™s there are users whose display_name are;

- Young One
- younG Two
- You and Me

### Search Criteria

To search for users whose `display_name` begins with "you" (case-insensitive), you can query Firestore on `display_name_lowercase` field and display the results in a `ListView`.

### Important Note

Allowing users to search for other users with a single letter, like `a`, can result in a large number of users being listed. This can lead to spam messages being sent to users whom they don't know. To prevent this, it is recommended to limit the search to words that are longer than 3 or 4 characters. This helps ensure that search results are more specific and reduces the likelihood of spam.
