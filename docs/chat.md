# Chat

## Chat Logic

### User Invitation and Consent

We prevent bad users from sending messages to good users.

### Chat Room Structure

Each chat room has a `users` field, which is a map with user IDs (`uid`) as keys and a boolean as values.

#### Example of `users` Field

```json
{
  "users": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false
  }
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Creating a Chat Room**:
    1. When User A starts a chat with User B, a chat room is created with the `users` field.
    2. `A: true` means User A has initiated the chat.
    3. `B: false` means User B has not yet accepted the chat.
2. **Visibility of Chat Room**:
    1. The chat room appears in User A's chat room list.
    2. The chat room does not appear in User B's chat room list until User A sends a message.
3. **Sending a Message**:
    1. When User A sends a message, the chat room becomes visible in User B's chat room list.
4. **User B's Consent**:
    1. Since `B` is `false`, User B sees a confirmation dialog when they tap on the chat room.
    2. If User B accepts, `B` is set to `true`, and the confirmation dialog will no longer appear.

This process ensures that users have control over who can send them messages and join their chat rooms.

## Chat Room

### How to Create a Chat Room

1. **Open Create Chat Room Dialog**:

    1. Alternatively, use `editChatRoom` which supports both creation and update.
3. **Open the Chat Room**:
    1. After creating the chat room, open it for the user.

### How to Update a Chat Room

1. **Open Update Chat Room Dialog**:
2. Call the `updateChatRoom` custom action.
    1. Alternatively, use `editChatRoom` which supports both creation and update.
3. **Close the Dialog**:

### Example

Here is an example of source code for creating or updating a chat room.

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    if (widget.roomId != null) {
      await updateChatRoom(
        widget.roomId!,
        nameController.text,
        descriptionController.text,
        iconUrl,
        open,
        canInvite,
      );
      Navigator.of(context).pop();
      return;
    }
    final roomId = await createChatRoom(
      nameController.text,
      descriptionController.text,
      iconUrl,
      open,
      canInvite,
    );
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
    showGeneralDialog(
      context: context,
      pageBuilder: (_, __, ___) {
        return ChatRoomScreen(
          roomId: roomId,
        );
      },
    );
  },
  child: const Text('Save'),
```





## How to list my Chat Room List


1. Add **ChatRoomListView** custom widget into body in a screen


2. Use onTap action to open a chat room.



### Customizing Chat Room List with Custom Code

Below is a sample code of how you can use the chat room list view widget.

    pageBuilder: (_, __, ___) {
      return ChatRoomScreen(roomId: roomId);
    },
  ),
),
```



### Customizing Chat Room List with Component

      name: join.name,
      iconUrl: join.iconUrl,
      displayName: join.displayName,
      photoUrl: join.photoUrl,
      group: join.group,
      single: join.single,
      open: join.open,
      lastMessageAt: join.lastMessageAt,
      lastMessageDeleted: join.lastMessageDeleted,
      lastText: join.lastText,
      lastUrl: join.lastUrl,
      lastProtocol: join.lastProtocol,
      unreadMessageCount: join.unreadMessageCount,

      single: room.single,
      group: room.group,
      lastMessageAt: room.lastMessageAt,
      allMembersCanInvite: room.allMembersCanInvite,
    );
```



## Opening a chat room screen

1. Create a chat room screen with parameter roomId as String

2. Add ChatMessageListView custom widget from Super library and pass the roomId onto it.

3. Add a TextField widget and a Button
